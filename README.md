# odin-etch-a-stetch

You can view the live demo for this project [here](https://jaredguzman.github.io/odin-etch-a-stetch/)!

This one was a lot of fun, and required me to think through a lot of different ways of doing things to get everything to work. I want to learn a little bit more about JS and then come back to refactor this code, but I think that the way I did it for now wasn't that bad. The hardest part was definitely making the 'opacity mode' function work. It required me to store values locally using an array, and then update that array every time the pixel was interacted with.

But yeah, I learned a lot doing this exercise and I could see how things can come together in an actual functioncal product a little bit more clearly now.
